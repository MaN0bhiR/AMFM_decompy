SignalObj Class
---------------

The SignalObj Class stores the speech signal and all the parameters related to it. It must be noticed that the SignalObj here is different from the pyQHM module one.

USAGE:

.. py:function:: SignalObj(args)
    :module: amfm_decompy.pYAAPT

    :param args: the input argument can be a string with the wav file path OR a tuple containing the speech signal data and its fundamental frequency in Hz.

    :rtype: speech signal object.

SIGNAL OBJECT ATTRIBUTES:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. py:attribute:: data
    :module: SignalObj

    Numpy array containing the speech signal data. It is set during the object's initialization.

.. py:attribute:: fs
    :module: SignalObj

    Sample frequency in Hz. It is set during the object's initialization.

.. py:attribute:: size
    :module: SignalObj

    Speech signal length. It is set during the object's initialization.

.. py:attribute:: filtered
    :module: SignalObj

    Bandpassed version from the speech data. It is set by the SignalObj.filtered_version method.

.. py:attribute:: new_fs
    :module: SignalObj

    Downsampled fundamental frequency from the speech data. It is set by the SignalObj.filtered_version method.


SIGNAL OBJECT METHODS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. py:method:: filtered_version(bp_filter)
    :module: SignalObj

    :param bp_filter: BandpassFilter object.

    Filters the signal data by a bandpass filter.
